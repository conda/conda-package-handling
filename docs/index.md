# Welcome to conda-package-handling's documentation!

`conda-package-handling` is a library and command line utility used to handle
`.conda` and `.tar.bz2` [conda
packages](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/packages.html).

`conda` and `conda-build` use `conda_package_handling.api` to create and extract
conda packages. This package also provides the `cph` command line tool to
extract, create, and convert between formats.

## A new major version

As of version 2.x, `conda-package-handling` provides a backwards-compatible
wrapper around
[`conda-package-streaming`](https://conda.github.io/conda-package-streaming/),
plus additional package creation functionality not found in
`conda-package-streaming`. `conda-package-handling` always expects to read and
write to the filesystem. If you need a simpler API to extract or inspect conda
packages, check out
[`conda-package-streaming`](https://conda.github.io/conda-package-streaming/).

Version 2.x is approximately two times faster extracting `.conda` packages, by
extracting `.conda`'s embedded `.tar.zst` without first writing it to a
temporary file. It uses
[`python-zstandard`](https://github.com/indygreg/python-zstandard) and the
Python standard library instead of a custom `libarchive` and so is easier to
build. Extraction does not `chdir` to the output directory, and is thread-safe.

Version 2.x creates `.conda` packages slightly differently as well.

* `.conda`'s `info-` archive comes after the `pkg-` archive.
* Inside `.conda`, the `info-` and `pkg-`'s ZIP metadata use a fixed timestamp,
  instead of the current time - can be seen with `python -m zipfile -l
  [filename].conda`.
* `.conda`'s embedded `.tar.zst` strip `uid`/`gid`/`username`/`groupname`
  instead of preserving these from the filesystem.
* Both `.conda` and `.tar.bz2` are created by Python's standard `zipfile` and
  `tarfile` instead of `libarchive`.

No particular attention has been paid to archiving time which will be dominated
by the compression algorithm, but this also avoids using a temporary `.tar.zst`.

## Overview

There are two conda formats. The new conda format, described at [.conda file
format](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/packages.html?highlight=format#conda-file-format),
consists of an outer, uncompressed ZIP-format container, with 2 inner compressed
.tar files. It is designed to have much faster metadata access and utilize more
modern compression algorithms. The old conda format is a `.tar.bz2` archive.

The cph command line tool can transmute (convert) the old package format to the
new one, and vice versa.

```
cph transmute mkl-2018.0.3-1.tar.bz2 .conda
```

The new package format is an indexed, uncompressed zip file that contains two
Zstandard-compressed tarfiles. The info metadata about packages is separated
into its own tarfile from the rest of the package contents. By doing this, we
can extract only the metadata, for speeding up operations like indexing.

And, the Zstandard algorithm is much, much faster to decompress than bz2.

Package creation is primarily something that conda-build uses, as cph only
packages but does not create metadata that makes a conda package useful.

```
cph create /path/to/some/dir my-cute-archive.conda
```

This would not necessarily create a valid conda package, unless the directory
being archived contained all the metadata in an "info" directory that a standard
conda package needs. The .conda file it creates, however, uses all the nice new
compression formats, though, and you could use cph on some other computer to
extract it.
